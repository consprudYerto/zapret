# Reset Windows Password Uefi Boot
 
 
What to do if you forgot Windows 10 password on a GPT/UEFI-based computer? Secure Boot and UEFI is something that has been introduced with Windows 8, which stops you from accessing the hard drive when booting to CD or USB and therefore stops you using traditional tools to reset your Windows password.
 
PCUnlocker is the unique password removal utility that allows you to reset Windows 10 password on computers with UEFI Secure Boot enabled. Let's walk through the process of resetting Windows 10 password by creating an UEFI bootable media.

After purchasing the full version of PCUnlocker Enterprise, you'll get the download link of PCUnlocker\_UEFI\_x64.zip. Unzip it and you'll get the UEFI bootable ISO image of PCUnlocker. Burn the ISO image to a blank CD or USB flash drive using ISO2Disc.
 
Connect the CD or USB drive to your locked Windows 10 computer. Turn on the computer and press a key like F12 to bring up the Boot Menu. The exact key depends on the motherboard of your computer. If you can't find a way to access the Boot Menu, you can either head over to BIOS for changing the boot order: set the CD or USB drive as the first boot media.
 
Now the computer will boot from the CD/USB drive in UEFI mode. After a while, you'll see the PCUnlocker program itself, which automatically searches your Windows 10 SAM registry file and locates all Windows 10 user accounts existing on your computer.
 
Choose a user account and then click on **Reset Password** button. The program will remove / reset your lost Windows 10 password, as well as unlocking the selected user account in case it is disabled, locked out or expired.

If you have forgotten your administrator account password, or the administrator user account has been locked out or disabled, and you can not gain access to the account, you can burn a Lazesoft Recover My Password CD or USB flash drive. You can boot from the new medium to clear your administrator's password and unlock the user account.


 If you have lost your Windows password, you can download our Lazesoft Recover My Password setup file, and use it to burn a bootable CD or USB flash drive. You can use your CD or USB flash drive to reboot, and then reset your forgotten Windows administrator password to blank, allowing you to access your account.
 
"If you've ever stared at the login screen and cursed at being locked out of a system this program is a GODSEND. Easy to use and quiet brilliant. A friend's system had been brought to me with this exact problem (evidently their 9 year old had wanted to change the Password and had promptly forgotten what he had chosen)No matter how many attempts the Login screen wouldnt allow them past. This program allowed me to delete their old password (their 9 year old's name spelled backwards btw)and create a new one. System rebooted and entered Vista SP1 at the first try. Thank you. This is a great program." --Argonaught
 
BIOS is an acronym for Basic Input or Output System, also known as system setup or UEFI. BIOS or UEFI is a firmware that is embedded on a small memory chip on the computer's system board or motherboard. It acts as an interface between the computer's hardware and the operating system. The BIOS or UEFI also contains instructions that the computer uses to perform basic instructions such as date, time, whether to boot from a hard disk drive, USB drive, or the network, and so on.
 
**BIOS passwords cannot be recovered**. If you have forgotten one of the passwords that is set in the BIOS, contact Dell Technical Support to obtain a password release code. The password release code is based on the unique password prompt that is generated using information from your Dell laptop.
 
**BIOS passwords cannot be recovered**. If you have forgotten one of the passwords that is set in the BIOS, resetting the CMOS or NVRAM helps reset the BIOS to factory default settings and remove the passwords from the BIOS.
 
History: We had our AD directory box keel over, so we had to replace it. I now get a trust issue on the computer, when attempting to log in. The solution is to log into the box, remove from the domain, delete the computer from the Active Directory Users and Computers, add back to the domain, and then test the login.
 
The problem is that I cannot log into the workstation using any domain user account (trust domain issue). That is normal for Microsoft. That is not a problem, but that the built-in Administrator account is disabled is the problem.
 
I have a license for Renee PassNow Pro, which is an awesome utility. You create a USB disk or a CD (I chose USB), and then you boot off of it. The app allows you to clear the password for any account and enable any account. The software works major awesomeness with any BIOS/MBR system (older computers), not so great with UEFI/GPT systems.
 
I could care less about PassNow Pro. I am not wedded to it, so my question is not related to them. My question is now to solve the problem. I need to enable the built-in Administrator account and then reset the password. I am open to another utility, a Mark Russinovich (he is the guru at Microsoft who started sysinternals and founded the concept of a ponytail for real driver geeks), or an incantation (think Once Upon a Time or Harry Potter), whatever works. I do not have a wand, so...
 
The recommended equivalent post, admin, was a nice try. I tried it. Sadly, step 7 after entering REM\_SAM, resulted in a permission denied file is in use error. That took care of that. I was not able to get into safe mode, so that took care of the second answer.
 
I found a tool long ago. Some call it a rescue CD. It boots and handles UEFI and GPT. It also includes the Offline NT Password and Registry Editor mentioned above. It also includes many other neat utilities. Offline NT Password and Registry Editor".
 
You can set a power-on password, supervisor password, system management password, or NVMe password in UEFI BIOS to prevent unauthorized access to your computer. However, you are not prompted to enter any UEFI BIOS password when your computer resumes from sleep mode.
 
The supervisor password protects the system information stored in UEFI BIOS. When entering the UEFI BIOS menu, enter the correct supervisor password in the window prompted. You also can press Enter to skip the password prompt. However, you cannot change most of the system configuration options in UEFI BIOS.
 
If you have set both the supervisor password and power-on password, you can use the supervisor password to access your computer when you turn it on. The supervisor password overrides the power-on password.
 
The system management password can also protect the system information stored in UEFI BIOS like a supervisor password, but it has lower authority by default. The system management password can be set through the UEFI BIOS menu or through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) with the Lenovo client-management interface.
 
You can enable the system management password to have the same authority as the supervisor password to control security-related features. To customize the authority of the system management password through the UEFI BIOS menu:
 
If you have set both the supervisor password and the system management password, the supervisor password overrides the system management password. If you have set both the system management password and the power-on password, the system management password overrides the power-on password.
 
The NVMe password prevents unauthorized access to the data on the storage drive. When an NVMe password is set, you are prompted to type a correct password each time you try to access the storage drive.
 
If you forget your supervisor password, there is no service procedure to remove the password. You have to contact a Lenovo authorized service provider to have the system board replaced. A fee will be charged for parts and service.
 
This feature allows you to reset the UEFI BIOS to the factory default settings, including all UEFI BIOS settings and internal data. It helps you wipe user data in case that you want to dispose of or reuse your computer.
 
Your computer will restart immediately. It take several minutes to complete the initialization. Your computer screen might be blank during this process. This is normal and you should not interrupt it.
 
Microsoft constantly makes updates to the Windows operating system. Before installing a particular Windows version, check the compatibility list for the Windows version. For details, go to Lenovo windows support.
